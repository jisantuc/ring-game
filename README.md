# Ring Game

One way you can play pool is in a _ring game_ which is a way to play with more
than two players. Here's the banks ring game from the [2022 Derby City Classic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itlmp8Bajus)
for example. In this format, instead of trying to win a rack of 9 ball,
you're trying to collect all the other players' chips. One problem is that
this means you have to leave the house to go to the pool hall _knowing_ that you'll
need chips. However, sometimes you might be out somewhere and only then realize that
you'd like to play a ring game. What to do?? ðŸ¤”

This repo implements an application for mimicking the transfer of chips so that
you can play ring games using just your phone.
